# Language & Regional Settings

Excel works slightly differently depending on the language and regional settings of Excel and your version of Windows. The videos show the US-English version, so make sure to change the samples according to your version of Excel.

## Function arguments
Note that Excel uses different separators to separate arguments in functions. In the English version, it is ",", while in some other languages it is ";". Make sure to adjust this when copying over samples from the course material e.g. instead of "=SUM(A1,B2)" use "=SUM(A1;B2)" if you get an error. For more details on how to manage these settings, see: https://exceljet.net/glossary/list-separator

## Translated names
Instead of "Book" and "Sheet" you will have other names in other languages.
Inside structured references of Excel Tables, you'll have things like #All that is also translated
